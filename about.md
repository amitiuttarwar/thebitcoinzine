We so often refer to the culture surrounding Bitcoin, but what does that mean
outside of the intangible ramblings strewn across crypto Twitter, mailing
lists, and chat rooms? This is an attempt at visually memorializing the many
stories of Bitcoin as we see it. Zines, or similar literary outlets, have
served as an expressive outlet for sub-culture uprising for centuries. The
Bitcoin Zine intends to continue that trend for the movement around the open
source, private, free money revolution.
